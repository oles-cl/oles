&lt;p>Why do some people view excessive police violence as acceptable? We reason that excessive police violence not only seeks to control crime, but also to punish criminal offenders. We propose the concept of police violence for punishment and explore its associations with different forms of punishment and punishment motivations. We reason that some people support excessive police violence to reinforce status and power hierarchies with minority groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="method">Method&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We draw on data from a representative sample of adults living in Chile conducted in 2015 (n=1,302). We use structural equation models to predict support for police violence for punishment, legal and extra-legal violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="results">Results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Police violence for punishment was strongly related to support for extra-legal punishment. Punitive police violence and extra-legal punishment were both predicted by the motivation to restore status and power relationships, followed by deterrence. In contrast, norm restoration was the main predictor of legal punishment. Police violence for punishment was significantly less supported by ethnic minority members.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We conclude that police excessive use of force can usefully be understood as police violence as punishment. We discuss the extent to which police repression is perceived to restore status and power hierarchies threatened by crime. We conclude that reducing police violence requires a political and cultural process well beyond reforming police protocols and procedures. Working towards more horizontal relations between police officers, citizens and minority groups should reduce perceived needs to restore power and status relationships, hereby reducing support for police violence as punishment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Acting collectively to confront injustice</title><link>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica0/</guid><description/></item><item><title>On the justification of intergroup violence: The roles of procedural justice, police legitimacy, and group identity in attitudes toward violence among indigenous people</title><link>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica5/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="objective">Objective&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Why do people justify intergroup violence? We examine public attitudes toward violence perpetrated by indigenous activists to claim for rights and violence by police officers against indigenous people. We assess the roles that group identity, perceived police legitimacy, and procedurally just policing toward indigenous people play in the justification of intergroup violence among members of that minority group. Method: We present findings from 2 surveys (Study 1, n = 1,493; Study 2, n = 198) and an experiment (Study 3, n = 76) conducted among indigenous people in Chile. Studies 1 and 2 measure, and Study 3 manipulates, perceptions of police procedural justice toward indigenous people. Effects of procedural justice on police legitimacy (Studies 2 and 3) and attitudes toward violence for social change and social control (Studies 1–3) are analyzed. Result: Higher perceptions of procedurally just policing toward indigenous people predict higher support for police violence and lower support for violence perpetrated by indigenous activists. These effects are mediated by perceived police legitimacy and moderated by identification with the minority group. Among indigenous people who identify strongly with their group, perceiving high procedural justice predicts greater police legitimacy, greater support for police violence, and lesser support for violence perpetrated by indigenous activists. Conclusions: Findings contribute to an emerging literature on the roles of procedural justice and legitimacy in violence perceptions. They suggest that fair, respectful, and neutral treatment by police officers toward indigenous people may shape people’s views on the appropriateness of various forms of police and civic violence in a particular intergroup context.

&lt;p>Under what conditions do people support police use of force? In this paper we assess some of the empirical links between police legitimacy, political ideology (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and support for ‘reasonable’ use of force (e.g. an officer striking a citizen in self-defence) and ‘excessive’ use of force (e.g. an officer using violence to arrest an unarmed person who is not offering violent resistance). Analysing data from an online survey with US participants (n = 186) we find that legitimacy is a positive predictor of reasonable but not excessive police use of force, and that political ideology predicts support for excessive but not reasonable use of force. We conclude with the idea that legitimacy places normative constraints around police power. On the one hand, legitimacy is associated with increased support for the use of force, but only when violence is bounded within certain acceptable limits. On the other hand, excessive use of force seems to require an extra-legal justification that is – at least in our analysis – partly ideological. Our findings open up a new direction of research in what is currently a rather sparse psychological literature on the ability of legitimacy to ‘tame’ coercive power.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development and validation of a scale of support for violence in the context of intergroup conflict (SVIC): The case of violence perpetrated by Mapuche people and the police in Chile</title><link>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica3/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We develop and validate a scale that measures support for violence in the context of an asymmetrical intergroup conflict between the Chilean state and the largest ethnic minority group in Chile, the Mapuche people: the scale of Support for Violence in an Intergroup Conflict (SVIC). The proposed scale has two dimensions that capture the perceived acceptability of violence carried out in both directions: support for violence carried out by radical Mapuche activists and support for violence carried out by the police in the name of the Chilean state. We validate the scale in a survey conducted using two independent samples: a sample of Mapuche (n1=199) and a sample of non-indigenous Chilean respondents (n2=195). We test measurement invariance of the scale and find evidence that it is a valid instrument across both samples. Furthermore, findings suggest that the scale has discriminant validity, i.e., it correlates weakly with aggressiveness; as well as convergent validity, i.e., support for violence carried out by Mapuche activists correlates positively with Mapuche identification and negatively with Chilean identification, and the reverse is true for support for violence carried out by the police. We finish by highlighting the importance of measuring support for violence in the context of an asymmetrical intergroup conflict considering violence carried out by the different parties involved in the conflict, as well as the importance of validating the scale considering samples of representatives of both parties.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Authority and Punishment: On the Ideological Basis of Punitive Attitudes towards Criminals</title><link>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Three explanations dominate the literature as to why people support tough sentencing of criminal offenders. The first is an instrumental perspective: people are concerned about becoming a victim of crime and they look to punishment to reduce future harm. The second is a relational perspective: people are concerned about community breakdown, and they support punishment to restore moral boundaries. The third is a psychological model based on ideological preferences: people desire conformity and authority in society, and they look to institutions to punish transgressions that threaten collective security. Building on the work of Tyler and Boeckmann (1977), we show that right-wing authoritarianism predicts both the extent to which people worry about social threats and the extent to which they support harsh punitive measures. Bridging research from political psychology and criminology, we conclude with the idea that popular punitive sentiment is grounded in an uncritical submission to authorities, an adherence to conservative moral values, and consonant concerns about collective security and cohesion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Control Social y Justificación de la Violencia en Chile.

&lt;p>La exposición a riesgos psicosociales y violencia laboral se asocia con una mayor presencia de problemas de salud mental en los/as trabajadores/as. El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo indagar el rol mediador de la violencia laboral entre los riesgos psicosociales (ISOSTRAIN, desbalance esfuerzo-recompensa), antecedentes organizacionales (liderazgo tiránico) y problemas de salud mental (distrés) en 1023 trabajadores/as de tres hospitales públicos chilenos de alta complejidad de tres regiones del país. Se hipotetizó que la exposición a riesgos psicosociales y algunas características organizacionales (liderazgo tiránico) se asocia a menores niveles de salud mental y que parte de este efecto se encuentra mediado por la exposición a violencia laboral. Se aplicó un cuestionario incluyendo el Negative Act Questionnaire Revised (NAQ-R), el Screening de Distrés Psicológico, la Escala de Liderazgo Destructivo, el Cuestionario de Desbalance Esfuerzo-Recompensa y el Job Content Questionnaire. Mediante análisis de senderos, se observó que la exposición a riesgos psicosociales, liderazgo tiránico y violencia laboral aumenta los niveles de distrés de los/as trabajadores/as. Parte del efecto de los riesgos psicosociales y el liderazgo tiránico en la salud mental se encuentra mediado por la exposición a violencia laboral. El artículo termina discutiendo la necesidad de avanzar en protocolos y prevención de riesgos psicosociales y violencia laboral, en particular en el contexto del trabajo en salud pública.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social Identities and Conflict in Chile: The Role of Historical and Political Processes</title><link>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica7/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In this chapter, we seek to integrate historical and contextual perspectives with socio-psychological theories to better understand the development of social identities and conflicts in Chile. Specifically, we analyse across different contexts, ethnic identity, national identity in the context of immigration, political, gender and social class identities. We address the historical background that gave rise to status and power differences, the nature of these intergroup relations and the conflicts associated with the groups involved. We conclude by arguing that in order for a modern society to tackle the challenges imposed by multiculturalism and social diversity, historical and political processes need to be considered, in addition to the needs of belonging, distinctiveness and factors that might threaten social identities. Fostering opportunities to experience positive intergroup encounters, in which, groups can learn from each other and more importantly, can live in peace without feeling threatened by the presence of other groups is seen as crucial.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Public Opinion Towards the Lay Magistracy and the Sentencing Council Guidelines: The Effects of Information on Attitudes</title><link>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.oles.cl/publication/ja-monica6/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="objective">Objective&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Public opinion surveys have long documented public criticism of ‘lenient’ sentencers. There are two principal perceptions contributing to negative attitudes: a lack of community input and the view that sentencers determine sentence according to their own views. This study embeds an experimental design within a representative survey of respondents in England and Wales (n = 1,004), supplemented by laboratory-based work (n = 230) and focus groups. Results demonstrated that the public is ill-informed about both the magistracy and the sentencing guidelines. In addition, providing information about sentencing changed public attitudes to sentencing and reduced public punitiveness. Respondents were less critical of disposals and less punitive in their own sentence recommendations when they had been given context about the structure of sentencing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
