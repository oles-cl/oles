  abstract = {The teaching of research methods in higher education has gained great importance in the last decades, but we still know little about different teaching methods and their meaning for students. Although there is a burgeoning literature on research methods training, there are still few contributions that salvage the experiences and meanings associated with research practices. This article examines the meanings and experiences of research training among students of social sciences careers based on their participation in a research observatory at a university in Santiago, Chile. Using the technique of thematic content analysis, six individual interviews and one focus group were analyzed in which the meanings associated with research, their formative experience in research methodologies, as well as the meanings associated with research after their participation in different activities of the observatory were analyzed. Among the main findings, the meanings assigned to research as an input for social transformation or decision making stand out. In addition, the importance of insertion in early research practices and the experience of participation in the observatory as a space for creative ways in research activity.},
